deploment model:
	depends on user
	4 types: public, private, community, hybrid
	parameters: size of cc, type of provider and user, location, security etc


private cloud:
	( pehle jo pata hai iske baare mein likh dena )
	single org but multiple consumers
	ex: openstack, eucalyptus
	small in size compared to other

	charactersitics:
		secure
		central control
		weak SLA: since owned by company so some SLA may not be valid or they r weak

	suitability:
		need separate cloud
		have sufficient funds
		data security is issue
		want complete control
		have less users
		(basically iski advantage ki application)

	not suitable:
		high user base
		low finance
		dont have prebuilt infra
		dont have manpower to maintain
		(drawbacks + suitability ka ulta soch lo)

	adv:
		small in size + easy to maintain
		security and privacy
		controlled by org

	disadv:
		budget constraint
		loose SLA

	2 types:
		on premise
		outsourced

		issues:
			SLA
			network
			location
			mantenance
			security
			performance
			management

			(dono mein kuch likh dena like on wala zyada secure, on site, managed by company, weak sla wagerah aur off mein ulta iska + sla in on = employee and company, sla in off: company and third party)


public cloud:
	(jo aata hai woh likh dena)
	resource seems infinite
	ex: ms azure, aws

	characteristics:
		highly scalable
		affordable
		less secure
		high available
		strict sla

	suitability:
		requirement is large
		reqm is varying
		no physical infra available
		finance constraints

	not suitable:
		when need security
		when need autonomy
		third party reliability not preferred

	adv:
		infra not established
		no need to maintain
		less costly than others
		strict sla's
		no limit to user
		scalable

	disadv:
		security
		autonomy not possible

	issues:
		sla: strict and bw user and provider
		network: user is responsible unlike in private, => easy to mantain by provider
		performance: challenging if user base increases
		multitenancy
		security
		location: user in 1 country and data in another(not good)
		mngmnt: difficult
		mantenance: overall tough


community cloud:
	( pehle wahi same jo tumhe aata hai)
	kindof multiple private network
	for those who can't afford private alone and dont trust public

	characteristics:
		collaborative and distributed maintenance
		partial secure: safe from the outside but not inside
		cost effective

	suitability:
		need private but low money
		dont want to maintain completely
		wanna colab with others
		more security than public

	not suitable:
		prefer anatomy
		doesnt want to colab

	adv:
		low cost private cloud
		colab possible
		shared responsibilty
		better security than public

	disadv:
		no autonomy
		less secure than private
		no colab = not suitable

	2 types:
		on premise and outsourced
		(same like private bs thoda add kr dena multiple org wala part)


hybrid cloud
	comb of them
	remain unique but bound by proprietary right
	initially private then additional resource of public cloud
	ex: eucalyptus

	characteristics:
		scalable
		partial secure (because of public)
		strict sla (less than public more than private)
		complex cloud management

	suitability:
		need private with scalable
		more security than public

	not suitable:
		want more security
		when not able to handle management

	adv:
		power of both private and public
		scalable
		better security than public

	disav:
		complex management
		strict sla

	issues:
		sla: depends on service provider(private cloud), private->weak, public-> strict
		network: mainly private use public when needed => org has to put effort in management
		performance: feel of infinite resource
		multitenancy: because public therefore can be misused
		location: issues of private and public
		security and privacy: 
		cloud mngmnt: by private
		maintenance: complex
