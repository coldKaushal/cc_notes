virtualisation:
	technique that enables single physical infrastructure to servce as multiple logical infrastructure
	!= cc

benefits:
	better resource utilisation
	increase roi
	dynamic data center
	supports green it
	eases adminstration
	improves disaster recovery

drawbacks:
	single point of failure
	demands high end and powerful infra
	may lead to lower performance
	reqd specialised skills

resources virtualised:
	1.)processor: abstracted from physical
	2.)memory: maps virtual page to physical page
	3.)storage: abstracted from physical, technique: san(storage area network), nas(network attached storage)
	4.)network: abstracted, router, switch, nic, achieved from internet or combining many external nw. network acesses: bridged nw, network address translation and host only
	5.) data: aggregate data from dif resource
	6.) app: use app without installing, enabling tech for saas

3 types of virtualisation see table at pg 198

hypervisors:
	sw tool that sits in between VM and physical infra and provide reqd virtual infra to vm
	also called vmm(virtual machine monitor)
	ex: VMware, Xen
	allow 1 to many relation bw hw and OS

types:
	type1: bare mental hv
	type2: hosted hv

bare mental hv:
	no host os
	run and access physical resource
	efficient as no overhead
	handle heavy load and are more secure
	ex: ms hyper V

hosted hv/embedded hv:
	requires host OS
	installed on host OS as sw
	host os= physical host
	low efficient
	is host OS crash then sys fails
	ex: VMware workstation

hosted hv more vulnerable to attacks

type of attacks:
	thru host os
	thru guest os

thru host os: 
	attack host os -> gain control -> can attack hypervisor -> can run priviledge instr and control hw
	attacker can do:
		denial of service attack
		steal confidential info

thru guest os:
	attack guest os-> compromise hypervisor ->  misuse hypervisor priviledge
	can be done on both type1 and type2
	attacker can do:
		get unauth access to other vm
		resource exhaustion

avoid attacks by:
	update hv sw and host os regularly
	disconnect unused resource
	enable least priviledge to hypervisor and guest OS
	deploy monitoring tools
	strong guest isolation

diff bw virtualisation and cc:
	vr: more iaas than paas and saas
	vr: not made on demand self service
	vr: fails to provide elasticity
	vr: target audience is IT owners not end users

iaas:
	vr concept fully used
	type1 hv selected

paas:
	uses OS, db, programming lang virtualisation
	various client tools like WEBCLI, RST API for accessing vr platform available to devs

saas:
	subs based rather than license based
	app lvl vr

in all 3 loadbalancers mantain the scalabilty. agr zyada virtualisation ho jaye to woh dusre server se virtualise kr dete hai
