capital expenditure: whole 
operation expenditure: for reqd service and time

cloud computing nist def:
	cc is a model for enabling, ubiqutous, convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider mech

need for cloud computing:
	economical
	convenient
	reliable
	secure


local computing: store/execution at ur machine
cloud computing: '' '' over internet


cc model : 5charactersitics, 3 service, 4 deployment

5 characteristics:
	on demand self service: unilaterally provision
	broad network access: thick/thin device
	elastic resource pooling: multitenant
	rapid elasticity: scale out/in
	measured service: monitoring

4 deployment model:
	depends on organisation's structure and provisioning location

	1.)private cloud: 1 organisation, on/off premises, owned by third party/org/combination of both
	2.)public cloud: for general public, on premise, owned by business/academic/govt
	3.)community cloud: cloud infra shared by several org, on/off premises, owned by org/third party, supports specific community, ex: mission/security mech
	4.) hybrid cloud: comb of 2 or more, ex: cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds

3 service model: 
	saas: crm, business intelligence analysis
	paas: google app engine, microsoft azure
	iaas: aws

note: org that have a sw package for a specific purpose and want to run on the cloud opt iaas over paas

cloud ecosystem: system of interdependent components
	actors: consumer/provider categorised into
		1.) CSU: cloud service users, ex: individual, enterprise, admins etc
		2.) CSP: cloud service provider, ex: provider of saas, iaas, paas
		3.) CSN: cloud service partner, ex: app dev, content provider, equipment provider

	example: tally

requirements of cc service:
	multitenancy
	service life cycle management
	security
	responsiveness
	regulatory aspects
	reliable,available and quality assurance
	massive data processing
	(bhot saare hai lekin yeh enough honge, inki kahaniya likh dena acc to marks)


reqm for iaas:
	hw reqm
	sw reqm
	storage regm
	netwrok reqm
	availability reqm(protection/backup)

reqm for paas:
	same as above
	deployment options for user(scale out options)

reqm for saas:
	app specific reqm
	network reqm


cloud application:
	app runs on cloud
	feature of desktop and web app
	fast response
	can work offline(unlike web)
	ex: gmail/dropbox

benfits of cc:
	accessibilty
	scalability
	reliable
	cost efficient
	dependabilty
	green IT

drawbacks:
	network dependent
	security
	no control on resources
	interoperabebility: 2 diff vendors do not cooperate with each other
